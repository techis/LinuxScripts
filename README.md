#pic.sh 
Use this script to take screen shots using scrot. This script allows 
you to take a selected area screen shot and then moves the file into 
your pictures directory. Feel free to alias it into bash with something 
like alias scrot="~/pic.sh". Also dont forget to make the script 
executable.
